This is your learning journal for learning the skills of a computer programmer being taught in **INFOSYS221**.
You will need to use the processes of version control in git, to make changes and commit these changes to your remote repository on gitHub.
> For every learning journal submission, you will need to add reflections in the format below. As you are adding reflections, you can copy & past the markdown formatting for each learning journal submission. An example is given below
	
##  Learning Journal 00
**1 Lecture content - Backward Looking**  
**Reflection Question #5. In what ways do you think you need to improve**  
*My original perception that it was a straight introduction to programming were not correct and I need to broaden my perception that the course includes other areas and skills that are important to being a computer programmer*  

**2 Lab content- Inward Looking**  
**Reflection Question #10. What did/do you find frustrating about it?**  
*I did not have sufficient computer literacy to move around my workstation and find files and folders - I just did not know where they were*  

**3 Course overall - Outward Looking**  
**Reflection Question #22. In what ways did you do it differently?**  
*When writing pseudocode, I spent more time thinking about the original problem and even tried to diagram a process of steps*  

##  Learning Journal 01  
**1 Lecture content - Backward Looking**  
**Reflection Question #3. Have you done a similar kind of work in the past (earlier in the year or in a previous grade; in school or out of
school)?**  
*In Summer School this year I took the course CompSci 120. From the first lecture I could already find many similarities in these 2 courses and have found that my learning from summer school has helped me better understand the lecture content in this course (especially in terms of finding steps to problem solve).*  

**2 Lab content- Inward Looking**  
**Reflection Question #11. What did/do you find frustrating about it?**  
*I was (and sometimes still am) having difficulty with using the new programs and being able to commit and push updates onto the remote repository online.*  

**3 Course overall - Outward Looking**  
**Reflection Question #23. In what ways was your work or process similar?**  
*I have found that so far when problem solving in this course we concentrate on the problem solving steps and thinking rather than the actual conclusion. We have been taught certain methods such as Polya's 4 stages of problem solving as a guide when trying to solve a question. This makes our problem solving process similar.*  

## Learning Journal 02
**1 Lecture content - Backward Looking**
**Reflection Question #4. In what ways have you gotten better at this kind of work?**
*At the beginning of this course I found the finding of the problem steps easy, however I found it quite challenging to show my thought process and the insights I found. Through these weeks since the beginning of the course I have had the opportunity to work through and do a lot of practice on this work that I found difficult (through labs and working on assignment 1), and due to this I have gotten a lot better at this kind of work.*

**2 Lab content - Inward Looking**
**Reflection Question #20 What does that tell you about yourself and how you learn?**
*From past experience, I have found myself to be more of an individual worker when compared to working in a group. This is because I often find it a bit more challenging to work with others and end up wanting the result to be presented in a way that I like. Through working in the lab with other students I have had to compromise this and adapt to working with other and not having everything my way. Once I overcame the challenges of this (even though I am still learning), I grew to enjoy group work a lot more than I originally did and embrace working with everyone’s ideas and thinking a little differently (maybe I just got lucky with the members in my team).*

**3 Assignment content - Outward Looking**
**Reflection Question #28. In what ways did your work meet the standards for this assignment?**
*I put in a lot of effort into my work and definitely believe that it meets the standards for the assignment. One of the things that I found more challenging starting this course was showing my thought process and personal insights, and this is exactly what I tired to put more effort into when working on the assignment. I tried to present my work in a clear way so that the marker is able to understand my thought processes as well as exactly what was going on in my head.*

**4 Course overall - Forward Looking**
**Reflection Question #37. What would you like to spend more time on in school?**
*In the future of this course, I would like to spend more time on working on exercises similar to those in class, and getting these marked and receiving feedback on this work. In a previous lecture, the lecturer had given feedback on exercises that the students had worked on in the previous lecture. I quite liked this as we not only received feedback on our own work, but also saw the work of other and how they could improve. This way we got to see the way our peers thought as well as getting questions answered that we may have not even thought of.*

## Learning Journal 03
**1 Lecture content - Forward Looking**
**Reflection Question #36. What's one goal you would like to set for yourself for next time?**
*One goal that I’d like the set for myself for future lecture is to participate more by asking and answering questions. I sometimes see other students doing this and I think it would be really beneficial for me to do so more. Furthermore, I feel that this may be easier in a physical lecture setting.*

**2 Lab content - Outward Looking**
**Reflection Question #29 In what ways did it not meet those standards?**
*Sometimes while doing group work in the labs, our group falls short of some points. Often times this may be because we misinterpreted the question or didn’t manage to meet all parts fully.*

**3 Assignment content - Inward Looking**
**Reflection Question #12. What were your standards for this piece of work?**
*My standards for this assignment were quite high as I believe that the group work for assignments that my group had done in the past was of high standard and I was set on meeting and exceeding that standard for this following group assignment (and future ones).*

**4 Course overall - Backward Looking**
**Reflection Question #5. 5. In what ways do you think you need to improve?**
*One thing I need to improve at in terms of the course overall is to spend more time revising the course content and practising it. This will be really beneficial to me, especially leading up to the exam.*

**Git content - Which git command did I use and why?**
*I use the git reset mixed as this resets back to the working directory. A soft reset would only reset back to the staging area, and a hard reset would remove any uncommited changes.*

## Learning Journal 04
**1 Lecture content**
*Overall, I am enjoying the lecture content. The content taught in the previous weeks has been particularly challenging to understand as writing JavaScript is a very new concept for me. However, I enjoy this challenge as I find the learning interesting and particularly rewarding when I finally understand it.*

**2 Lab content**
*I very much enjoy the lab content as it gives me a chance to prace my learnings from the lecture content. Additionally, I find it helpful to practice this alongside classmates so that we are able to collaborate together and I can get help when I am stuck (and visa-versa).*

**3 Mid Term Test content**
*I found the content of the Mid Term Test to be appropriate and relevant to the material learnt. However, I had difficulty trying to get through the whole test in the time given.

**4 Course overall**
*Overall, I am quite enjoying this course. I did not expect to learn such a variety coming into the course and am pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoy the content, even though I can find some things difficult at times. I also enjoy how we get assessed in this course through group projects and multiple assignments and tests to replace the exam.*

## Learning Journal 05
**1 Lecture content**
*I have found the lecture content of this course very enjoyable, although particularly challenging. What I have found most difficult has been the idea of different commits in order to transport something from my local repository on my desktop, to the git repository online.*

**2 Lab content**
*The collaborating aspect of the labs has been enjoyable as you are able to gain insite on how others interperate qusetions and solve certain problems. The timed aspect of the lab also adds to the challenge of it, although I have sometimes found that the time given is quite limited.*

**3 Course overall**
*The course overall is very enjoyable and different to other courses. I enjoyed having to work on one overall project throughout the semester (split into 4 different projects) with the same group of people. I would definetly recommened this course to others doing an information systems major.*
