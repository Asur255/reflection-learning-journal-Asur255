##  Learning Journal 00
**1 Lecture content - Backward Looking**  
**Reflection Question #5. In what ways do you think you need to improve**  
*My original perception that it was a straight introduction to programming were not correct and I need to broaden my perception that the course includes other areas and skills that are important to being a computer programmer*  

**2 Lab content- Inward Looking**  
**Reflection Question #10. What did/do you find frustrating about it?**  
*I did not have sufficient computer literacy to move around my workstation and find files and folders - I just did not know where they were*  

**3 Course overall - Outward Looking**  
**Reflection Question #22. In what ways did you do it differently?**  
*When writing pseudocode, I spent more time thinking about the original problem and even tried to diagram a process of steps*  

##  Learning Journal 01  
**1 Lecture content - Backward Looking**  
**Reflection Question #3. Have you done a similar kind of work in the past (earlier in the year or in a previous grade; in school or out of
school)?**  
*In Summer School this year I took the course CompSci 120. From the first lecture I could already find many similarities in these 2 courses and have found that my learning from summer school has helped me better understand the lecture content in this course (especially in terms of finding steps to problem solve).*  

**2 Lab content- Inward Looking**  
**Reflection Question #10. What did/do you find frustrating about it?**  
*I was (and sometimes still am) having difficulty with using the new programs and being able to commit and push updates onto the remote repository online.*
