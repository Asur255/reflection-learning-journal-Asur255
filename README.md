This is your learning journal for learning the skills of a computer programmer being taught in **INFOSYS221**.
You will need to use the processes of version control in git, to make changes and commit these changes to your remote repository on gitHub.
> For every learning journal submission, you will need to add reflections in the format below. As you are adding reflections, you can copy & past the markdown formatting for each learning journal submission. An example is given below
	
##  Learning Journal 00
**1 Lecture content - Backward Looking**  
**Reflection Question #5. In what ways do you think you need to improve**  
*My original perception that it was a straight introduction to programming were not correct and I need to broaden my perception that the course includes other areas and skills that are important to being a computer programmer*  

**2 Lab content- Inward Looking**  
**Reflection Question #10. What did/do you find frustrating about it?**  
*I did not have sufficient computer literacy to move around my workstation and find files and folders - I just did not know where they were*  

**3 Course overall - Outward Looking**  
**Reflection Question #22. In what ways did you do it differently?**  
*When writing pseudocode, I spent more time thinking about the original problem and even tried to diagram a process of steps*

**1 Lecture content - Backward Looking**  
**Reflection Question #3. Have you done a similar kind of work in the past (earlier in the year or in a previous grade; in school or out of
school)?**  
*In Summer School this year I took the course CompSci 120. From the first lecture I could already find many similarities in these 2 courses and have found that my learning from summer school has helped me better understand the lecture content in this course (especially in terms of finding steps to problem solve).*

**Reflection Question #11. What did/do you find frustrating about it?**  
*I was (and sometimes still am) having difficulty with using the new programs and being able to commit and push updates onto the remote repository online.*  

**3 Course overall - Outward Looking**  
**Reflection Question #23. In what ways was your work or process similar?**  
*I have found that so far when problem solving in this course we concentrate on the problem solving steps and thinking rather than the actual conclusion. We have been taught certain methods such as Polya's 4 stages of problem solving as a guide when trying to solve a question. This makes our problem solving process similar.*

**1 Lecture content - Backward Looking**
**Reflection Question #4. In what ways have you gotten better at this kind of work?**
*At the beginning of this course I found the finding of the problem steps easy, however I found it quite challenging to show my thought process and the insights I found. Through these weeks since the beginning of the course I have had the opportunity to work through and do a lot of practice on this work that I found difficult (through labs and working on assignment 1), and due to this I have gotten a lot better at this kind of work.*

**2 Lab content - Inward Looking**
**Reflection Question #20 What does that tell you about yourself and how you learn?**
*From past experience, I have found myself to be more of an individual worker when compared to working in a group. This is because I often find it a bit more challenging to work with others and end up wanting the result to be presented in a way that I like. Through working in the lab with other students I have had to compromise this and adapt to working with other and not having everything my way. Once I overcame the challenges of this (even though I am still learning), I grew to enjoy group work a lot more than I originally did and embrace working with everyone’s ideas and thinking a little differently (maybe I just got lucky with the members in my team).*

**3 Assignment content - Outward Looking**
**Reflection Question #28. In what ways did your work meet the standards for this assignment?**
*I put in a lot of effort into my work and definitely believe that it meets the standards for the assignment. One of the things that I found more challenging starting this course was showing my thought process and personal insights, and this is exactly what I tired to put more effort into when working on the assignment. I tried to present my work in a clear way so that the marker is able to understand my thought processes as well as exactly what was going on in my head.*

**4 Course overall - Forward Looking**
**Reflection Question #37. What would you like to spend more time on in school?**
*In the future of this course, I would like to spend more time on working on exercises similar to those in class, and getting these marked and receiving feedback on this work. In a previous lecture, the lecturer had given feedback on exercises that the students had worked on in the previous lecture. I quite liked this as we not only received feedback on our own work, but also saw the work of other and how they could improve. This way we got to see the way our peers thought as well as getting questions answered that we may have not even thought of.*

## Learning Journal 03
**1 Lecture content - Forward Looking**
**Reflection Question #36. What's one goal you would like to set for yourself for next time?**
*One goal that I’d like the set for myself for future lecture is to participate more by asking and answering questions. I sometimes see other students doing this and I think it would be really beneficial for me to do so more. Furthermore, I feel that this may be easier in a physical lecture setting.*

**2 Lab content - Outward Looking**
**Reflection Question #29 In what ways did it not meet those standards?**
*Sometimes while doing group work in the labs, our group falls short of some points. Often times this may be because we misinterpreted the question or didn’t manage to meet all parts fully.*

**3 Assignment content - Inward Looking**
**Reflection Question #10. What was especially satisfying to you about either the process or the finished product?**
*Something that I found specifically satisfying about the process of my group assignment was the teamwork and sharing of ideas throughout it. I believe that my team works really well together and that we are able to bounce off of each other.*
